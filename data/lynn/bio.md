One day, years back, I really wanted to learn how to juggle. So I did. I
practiced and practiced until I was pretty good, but sadly I never went
professional. I could do it while riding a bike, too.

Today, my juggling looks a little different; I have two kids, a full-time job as
a designer here, and a part-time woodworking business. The busiest days help me
appreciate living on a lake and the ability to escape life's stresses on my
boat.

I majored in graphic design with a minor in communications at Saginaw Valley
State University and have been creating ever since. My professional background
consists of designing apparel, magazines, advertisements, mobile apps, and UI/UX
for websites and web applications—just to name a few things.

Here at Redhead, I'm surrounded by creatives and people who thoroughly
understand the design process. This makes my job more enjoyable because I can
bounce ideas off of everyone and receive constructive feedback from every desk
in the office. A thoroughly collaborative environment is essential to excellent
design, and that's a big part of why I love coming into work every morning.

Creativity is everywhere. It's when I'm in my workshop finding the right wood
for a coffee table, designing a new website at work, or playing LEGOs® with my
kids. Creativity doesn't always mean reinventing the wheel, either. Many
times it means finding a new angle or an interesting, yet smart, twist on
things. It's an enticing challenge and one that I love to pursue.

When my right-brain is resting, I like to check out historic architecture and
landmarks around Lansing. Like I said, creativity is everywhere.
