Being the numbers person in an office full of creatives is somewhat like herding
cats. I pay bills, receive clients payments and prepare the bank deposit,
monitor the bank and credit card accounts, and create invoices. I create reports
for Jen to oversee all of these activities and special reports to analyze client
jobs and the companyâ€™s health. I make sure all the numbers balance. 

I like having a job that allows me to work with such creative people. I like
being able to keep the back-side financial part of the business in order so that
the team can create great items and strategies for our clients. My guess is that
vendors like that there's a numbers person around so the checks go out like
clockwork.

I love to read, and knit & crochet. I like being partially retired and being
able to be with my family more, helping with the transportation for my grandsons
many activities.

My career has taken me through being an educator and a manager. I have an BA in
math with a minor in secondary education from Ohio Northern University, and a ME
in math and computer science (Summa Cum Laude, thank you) from California
University of Pennsylvania.

The best part of being the most senior staff member is being able to impress
these kids with the fact that I got to be a hippie when that was a real thing,
and experience things like seeing Martin Luther King, Jr. speak at my college
campus.
