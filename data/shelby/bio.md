Ninety-nine percent of the time I ask the boss lady what the restrictions are on how to do something, she says, “Up to you.” I get to mess up and, usually, it’s OK. Because in the creative world “messing up” is actually just a part of the process. I get to work on really cool projects that affect real people in meaningful ways. Also, I get to wear jeans and Vans to work and it's totally acceptable.  Oh—no cubicles rocks. It’s good for me, but bad for everyone because they have to listen to my not-so-good jokes. Sorry, guys.

I’m almost done being a student at MSU, and I will graduate in May 2018 with a bachelor's degree in advertising and a minor in analytics. I read AdAge and AdWeek more than my textbooks. Thank God all my prerequisites are done because I truly hate 600-person lecture halls and 100-question exams on agriculture in the 1940s.

So what do I do? Well, I am a strategist. I am also a copywriter, photographer, analyst, project manager, and kinda-sorta-ish designer. I work with our team to plan and execute effective social media strategies to meet both short-term needs and overarching goals. Sometimes the overarching goal is directly related to social media, while other times it is a part of a giant marketing plan. Day-to-day, I oversee account activity and social communities for a handful of clients. Also, I write. A lot.

I really like watermelon. Seriously, I love it. One time my mom covered a watermelon in frosting for my birthday cake and it was the best birthday ever. Also, I definitely drink way too much coffee. You know when you go to the doctor and they ask you how much coffee you drink a day and you say two cups but it’s actually seven? Yeah, same.
