I am Corey Marie. I'm an illustrator, designer, maker, and creative overachiever.

I grew up in Eaton Rapids, and like many of my peers, knew pretty early on I was destined for a job in the creative industry. Even from a young age, I was more interested in commercial art than fine art. I wanted to do work that could make an impact or be useful, or at least be seen by a lot of people. 

I hoped to someday become a newspaper comic strip artist or work for a glossy print magazine. I was a teen in the '90s and asked for (and received!) a copy of Adobe PageMaker (before it was InDesign) for my birthday. I wasn't exactly "cool" in high school. Playing sousaphone in marching band and collecting Beanie Babies didn't help. But I was able to convince my friends to act as my "writing staff" and self-publish several issues of a zine.

I studied typography and humorous illustration at Lansing Community College before moving to San Diego for a job drawing caricatures in my early 20s. That's when I found my place on the web: making and sharing comics and blog posts. I taught myself HTML and CSS and started making sites for myself, friends, bands, comics, and other side hustles.

I'm obsessed with color and coincidence. I dye my hair turquoise (or cyan, if you prefer.)  I thrive on patterns and formulas. I love to read, and I spend a lot of time thinking about time travel. As a Libra, I find myself in constant pursuit of information, beauty, and fairness. 

At Redhead, I work as part of a team of creative folks to make web sites for our clients. I use HTML, CSS, and PHP to micromanage margins, pixels, and type in an ever-changing, dynamic digital environment. 

To me, web design is problem-solving. It takes a little bit of detective work to not just fix existing errors but to also anticipate potential problems and solve them before they even take place. Making sure websites don't break is practically the same as Batman keeping Gotham safe, right?
